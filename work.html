	<h3>
		Senior Mechanical Design Engineer
	</h3>
	<p>
		Along with designing, I also manage the Engineering Change Orders, ensuring to capture all the changes and making sure all the components still fit together. There's been a lot more listening here, whether it's the Contract Manufacturers, Product Team, or Service Team, I try to implement everything I can for a better product.

	<h3>
		Mechanical Design Engineer
	</h3>
	<p>
		During the first major design push, I owned the majority of the design development, rearchitecting the system to fit new heavy requirements in a highly accelerated timeline. This was a system overhaul that aimed to better meet the needs of assembly and service, as well cut down the number of previous manufacturing issues. I had the opportunity to really expand my design horizons with this, trying new techniques and learning so much from working with our suppliers. Some of my proudest designs went into this! I also improved processes and styles even further, revamping design reviews for better and more efficient communication.

				The Origin One printer. I've designed for this machine through my tenure at Origin and Stratasys, owning the sheet metal upper chamber assembly, containing lighting systems, heating systems, print process, electrical mounting. I've also owned the projector mounting and electrical mounting, working heavily with Electrical Engineers.

	<h3>
		Mechanical Design Engineer
	</h3>
	<p>
		Here, my first task was drafting, in which I learned the extreme importance of getting all the details just right and how to best communicate them with vendors. After that, I began owning designs. My designs focused heavily on usability and service of the Origin One system. I made improvements based on the feedback of my team and took in customer feedback to drive changes. I also began managing the product BOM, keeping it updated and ensuring that all parts were accounted for communicated to supply chain.

	<h3>
		Mechanical Engineer
	</h3>
	<p>
		My first full-time position. For the first 6 months, I actually worked on the assembly line as part of my training. I wanted to get some hands-on experience with product and get really good with tools. I was able to also improve the overall assembly process by producing some much needed tools with a 3D Printer and rearranging steps to be in parallel and mitigate bottlenecks. I was also able to explain and correct assembly issues which helped the company continue shipping product. I was moved to R&D where I designed for a new product, leading mechanical engineering efforts. I also developed tests and conducted Highly Accelerated Life Testing experiments.

				An FEA model of acrylic clips for engaging a vacuum to the spindle housing of the deskopt CNC mills. There was an ongoing issue of these clips snapping at the thin sections. This model allowed me to adjust the geometry to increase the strength by 50% and remove the issue for customers.

	<h3>
		Mechanical Engineer Intern
	</h3>
	<p>
		This was my first ever job as a mechanical engineer, an internship after graduating from UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). CycleSCP was still in its early phases and I came on to help develop the product specifications. My accomplishment here was figuring out how to create a device that could secure the majority of all bicycles. In the end, I created a prototype out of PVC pipe, tested it on volunteers' bicycles, and obtained user feedback.
